## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Florian Pasco, a **Engineering student** (specializing in **Electronics, Mechanicsand computer programming**).

👨‍💻 Here, I intend to propose most of my open-source projects for permise that everyone can enrich themselves with fairly simple and reusable projects in the fields of electronics, computer programming and mechanics.

🚲 Outside of the world of technology too, I like to elevate myself intellectually in various ways. My hobbies range from **cycling**, **repairing old bikes**, **petanque** to other more social ones like **being secretary of the cafeteria association of my school**.

📚 I also like to read books on **permaculture** and **federalism**.

⛺ I also really like **travelling** and discovering new things. Both in a close radius on foot and by bike but also on an expedition with my bike and my tent!
